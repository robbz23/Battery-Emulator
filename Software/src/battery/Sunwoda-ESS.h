Sunwoda BCMU (Battery Cluster Management Unit) home ESS battery, as used behind the
"FerroAMP" branded native Windows app.

CAN IDs follow the pattern 0x0C50FF00 + <address>, where <address> is the decimal
number embedded in the vendor's variable names (e.g. gMainInfo_80 -> 0x0C50FF00 + 80
= 0x0C50FF50). This mapping was reverse engineered from the vendor's BCMU_APP CAN
variable map together with a real CAN capture (see tools/pcanOut.txt), so treat
anything not explicitly listed here as unconfirmed.

CAN speed is not confirmed from the vendor documentation. 500kbit/s is assumed as a
starting point (most common default); change CAN_Speed below if the battery does not
appear on the bus.

  ADDRESSING - confirmed 2026-09-24 from a capture of the vendor's own tool talking to a real BCMU.

  The 29-bit ID is NOT "a base plus the object address". It is four bytes:

      priority | source node | destination node | object

  The BCMU's own node address is 0x50, so every 0x0C50FFxx frame is the BCMU BROADCASTING
  (src 0x50, dst 0xFF) its own telemetry. Those are fine to receive, and the ID_* constants below
  that decode incoming status still use SUNWODA_BASE_ID for exactly that reason.

  They are useless for commanding it. Transmitting 0x0C50FF46 means "I am the BCMU, broadcasting
  object 0x46 to everyone" - which is why the BCMU never once replied to us and never acted on a
  single command. To address the BCMU you send to dst 0x50 with your own address as src:

      10 64 50 00   20 00 04                 read object 0x00, 4 subindexes starting at 0
      12 50 64 00   63 00 B2 07 02 1A 10 33  BCMU replies: 0x07B2=1970, day 26/month 2, 16:51
      12 50 64 00   A1 03 BC 87              ...continued: subindex 3, millisecond 0x87BC
      10 64 50 36   20 00 01                 read object 0x36 (contactor self-test status)
      12 50 64 36   E1 00 00 00              BCMU replies: value 0

  Mux bit5 (0x20) marks an addressed request/response transaction; broadcasts have it clear.
  Bit6 = FIRST frame, bit7 = LAST frame, low nibble = subindex count (see the block further down).
  A read request is `20 <start_subindex> <count>`.

  NODE_ADDR_SELF is deliberately 0x64 - the address the vendor's own tool uses. Impersonating it is
  the one address we KNOW the BCMU answers, so it removes a variable while the ID format is still
  being proven. The vendor tool must be disconnected while we use it, or the two will collide.
  Once this is confirmed working, try moving to a free address (0x65 is a device on the BCMU's
  internal channel 2, 0x50 is the BCMU itself, so something like 0x66 is the natural candidate).

  on the priority byte, and case 0x00 (0x7F1197) calls the time-sync receiver 0x7F3180. It only
  requires that the frame arrives on the host bus and dst is 0xFF or the BCMU's address; the object
  byte is not checked (0x00 is used for clarity). The payload is raw, with no mux/subindex:

  MANUAL CONTACTOR CONTROL - verified on hardware 2026-09-25 (HWv2 / ES01 running BCMU V1.16).

  Contactor control is object 71 (gSwitchCtrl_71). One U16 per contactor, per the vendor sheet:
      71/0 main (positive)   71/1 precharge   71/2 "intermediate" = the NEGATIVE contactor   71/3 fan
  Codes: 0x00F0 normal engage, 0x000F normal disengage (0xFFF0/0xFF0F "forced" are not used here).

  Preconditions, from the V1.16 write handlers (object 70 at 0x7F94A5, object 71 at 0x7F951A):
    - Config parameter 1008 "Enable communication with BSMU" (EEPROM 0x13F3F0, RAM 0x0F8758) must be
      1, otherwise every object-70/71 write is ACKed and then silently dropped. It cannot be set over
      CAN (the config object refuses writes) - it has to be set once in EEPROM over BDM.
    - Work mode must be 8 "Debugging" (70/1 = 8). The mode switch is only accepted from Normal mode
      and outside Initialization; resending it while already in Debugging is harmless.
    - Not while the BCMU's own contactor sequence is busy (RAM 0x2E08).

  Multiplex byte format, confirmed 2026-09-24 by decoding the BCMU's own broadcasts against the
  subindex counts in its firmware TX schedule table (flash 0x7FD311):

                      bit7 (0x80) = LAST  frame of the transfer

  Worked examples straight off the bus - object 0x36 has 1 subindex and is sent as a single
  "C1 00 ..", object 0x34 has 4 and is sent as "43 00 .." (first, 3 items) then "81 03 .."
  (last, 1 item), object 0x5B has 7 and is sent as "43 00" / "03 03" / "81 06".

  So a complete write of one subindex is mux 0xC1 - FIRST and LAST set. We previously sent 0x41,
  which announces the first frame of a multi-frame transfer and promises a continuation that
  never arrived, so the BCMU never committed any of it. That is why no control command ever took
  effect, and why the BCMU never once answered a read request in an 88 s capture.
